Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.

     This project allows a user to view a dynamically changing 12 hour and 24 hour clock. The user can change the time of the clock while the clock is updating. This  Clock would allow any international clients to be updated on the current time in their preferred output format.
     
What did you do particularly well?

     I made the user interface clean and static by implementing a function that clears the screen after every update. I ensured there was proper input validation for inputs into the menu. The only values that are available to be inputted are within the menu. The code was commented well to avoid confusion for later programmers.
     
Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?

     I have a limited amount of knowledge on much of the functionality of multithreading in C++.  once I gain more knowledge on the basic functionality of multithreading I am sure there is some optimization I could do for the updating time function. I had to use global variables to update the clock and make the multithreading capabilities work.  I could have created a class and methods to access variables for the clock or create a separate namespace.
    
Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?

     The most difficult pieces of code involved multithreading. I did a lot of personal research to gain a basic understanding of using separate threads. I won't be adding multithreading to my support network until I properly learn a lot of the mechanisms that govern multithreading.
    
What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?

    The ability to implement multithreading will certainly be useful for later projects. The concept of avoiding magic numbers with constant variables helps maintainability. I also learned to read API documentation more clearly which will certainly be useful in later projects.
   
How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

     I made this code readable by adding comments for the purpose of individual functions. there are comments added to portions of the code that may be deemed confusing or is useful for a specific purpose. The white space of the code is organized in a consistent manner. The code avoids confusion with magic numbers by adding constant variables at the beginning of functions.
