*This repository includes the software design document created for this class

Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

 The client is a company named the game room. The client presented an idea for a game called Draw it or Lose it Where teams of players attempt to figure out the subject of an image that is slowly revealed to them during the course of the game. The company already works with this game on the Android platform and wants to expand to other platforms. The idea is to make the game work on a server and be available to users through a web browser. 
  
What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

  The best elements of the design document that I developed was the design constraints. The design constraints are simple but gives perspective on the limitations the game will have trying to run on a web-based platform. Having the application run on multiple screen resolutions, support multiple connections, and give consistent rendering times Helps the development team plan for these potential issues. 
  
What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

  The code that I developed for the system involved management of the server side game instances and it's attributes. The goal of having a consistent performance rate for the game ensured that I wrote code that is optimized and does not consume system resources. The UML diagram provided by the team certainly helped with developing code for the program. Other common elements of a design document such as other UML diagrams would help in creating code and meeting requirements for future additions to the program. 
  
If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

  I would choose the evaluation portion of the design document. The evaluation that I did for the design document is not as comprehensive as I would want it to be. I need more experience with the respective operating systems to make an informed decision. I would also like to add more options for cloud based systems in that evaluation. 
  
How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

  The clients described the game in a specific way where it needs to emphasize performance and memory usage to be compatible with different devices and their web browsers. Many of the design choices are made to ensure that the user has a pleasant experience when playing the game. If the user cannot play the game because of some technical issue that the software has, that will cause issues for our client. 
  
How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

  It is important to have an iterative process when working with new software. Starting from a place where the users requirements are the main consideration is important. Once the main portions of the software are organized and the function stubs are described,  the current status of the system can be shown to the client for evaluation. This process continues until the software meets the clients expectations. Designing software documents should use a similar process to ensure the clients and stakeholders vision is met.
