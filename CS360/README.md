# Description of Application
## Summarize the requirements and goals of the app
  The requirements and goals of the project was to create an simple event tracking application. The application needs to provide login authentication/authorization, CRUD (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) operations for the user's events, an SMS notification system to notify the end-user when their event is occuring, and a simple user-interface that is user-driven. The app was designed to provide the user with a simple method for tracking their personal events.
## What screens and features were necessary to support user needs?
  The main screen that demonstrates the need to support the end-user is the main-activity screen. This screen displays all of the user's events in a simple Grid layout. All of the buttons are easy to reach, including the navigation and individual events. The events are sorted so that current events are easy to reach and upcoming events are easy to see. The ultimate goal of the user-interface is to enable use of the application without having to shift your hand around the screen a lot.
## How did you approach the process of coding your app?
  I followed the concept of creating a minimal viable product and refactoring the code to encourage modularity, future extensibility, and easy refactoring. On bigger projects, I plan to use this concept extensively and create a persistent TODO list for refactoring large projects.
## Where was innovation necessary?
  The application is not the most innovative application. The only example I could think of for innovation is the connection between the fragments and activity code. I had to think of a way to track the currently selected event through different fragments and activities that remained static.
## What component were you successful in demonstrating your knowledge and skills?
  I think my ability to separate functionality of different systems in the app (database, notification system, and user-interface) into their own classes was a place were I was able to demonstrate my knowledge/skills/experience.
