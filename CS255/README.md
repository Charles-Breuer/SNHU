Repository for SNHU Class 255 System Analysis and Design
*This repository includes the business requirements document and system design document from this class.

Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

  The driver pass project involved a client that wanted to create and information system that allows customers to access online driving courses, organize driving reservations, and take practice tests. The system is meant to be run on a cloud based server that ensures security and stability for files available to different users. The system is meant to provide alternative education for drivers trying to pass their driving tests at the DMV.
  
What did you do particularly well?

  I created both the business requirements documents and the system design document for this system. I need multiple UML documents describing the system in different ways. These UML documents included class, use case, sequence, and activity diagrams. I ensured that the diagrams were clear, concise, and descriptive. The gantt charts that is provided in the business requirements document gives an efficient look at the schedule described by the team.
  
If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

  I would revise my business requirements document, specifically the requirements. As I progressed with other portions of the project, I learned more information about how to address requirements and the functionality needed for this type of software to work. I would add a few more requirements in the security section and revise many of the non functional requirements.
 
How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing? 

 The requirements in the business requirement document were the first step to determine the users needs. Many concepts were given to me explicitly such as adding activity reports or the protocol for adding a reservation. Some of the requirements were implicitly given, such as having a robust security given by the cloud provider. Adding security as a functionality is vague but holds a lot of options. The user is the individual that deals with the system on a daily basis. The users needs should be considered when designing a system for them.
  
How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

  I learned that designing software needs to be an iterative process. Creating a business requirements documents is only the first step in analyzing the needs of the client and the users. New developments can be made as other forms of analysis are taking place. It is important to review and revise all documents as needed during the process. Making attempts to clarify misconceptions about the current system and the needs of the new system is important. If the results of gathering data is only more questions, those questions need to be clarified before a proposal is made.
