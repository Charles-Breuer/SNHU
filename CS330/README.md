## How do I approach designing software? 
- What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
- What design process did you follow for your project work? 
- How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?

When designing software, I tried to go through a few steps to create an efficient workflow. Defining the purpose and end goals of the software is an important first step. The next step is to learn all of the required technology to achieve that goal. The next step is to create an outline for the implementation of the software. Typically, I create pseudocode and function stubs to define the structure of the application. Some specific goals for an application is to have functions/classes that are modular and reusable. For this application, I learned the importance of abstracting the implementation of a framework from the design of the application. When working on new projects, I will emphasize the modularity of an application for easy reuse. 
    
How do I approach developing programs?
    What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
    How did iteration factor into your development?
    How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
    
    The workflow for designing a 3D scene involves a short loop of: creating a small amount of code, running the program, check if desired outcome was achieved, and repeat. If too much code is written at once, it is hard to debug this type of program without external frameworks to assist. For each section of the project, small portion of the graphics pipeline is introduced. Creating reusable code at each stage allows for easy expansion until the project is finished.
    
How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
    How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
    How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
    
    I am still thinking about the specific job that I want to strive for in the field. Many fields including graphic design, game development, medical/business renderings, and architecture utilize computer graphics in their workflows. The knowledge of openGL gives a potential skill to present to an employee in one of these fields. I plan to complete the learning resources provided during this class to gain a deeper understanding of graphics. In education, I plan to learn about game design. Knowing how graphics are implemented at the lower levels is helpful when working on a game.
