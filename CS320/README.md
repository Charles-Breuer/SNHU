How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

  A mixture of black box and white box testing can ensure that software is functional and secure. Examples of this include equivalency testing, border testing, use case testing, states diagram testing, and other white box techniques such as unit testing and system integration. It is important to establish regression tests early to make sure new code does not cause issues for older code. Consistent testing and creating new tests based off of older issues will ensure that the code is robust.
  
How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

  Test cases need to be developed directly from user requirements. User requirements are gained from the knowledge base of the project and may need to be reassessed at different points in the software development life cycle. Proper analysis using different types of diagrams and requirements refactoring helps to ensure that test cases can be directly associated with user and stakeholder requirements. Focusing on the needs of the customer and not deviating ensures that tests are done efficiently.
  
How do I approach designing software?
  
  I designed software in a way that ensures any new bugs that are added to the program are easily detectable. Errors and issues in the software are inevitable, so it is important to be able to know where these issues come from and how to solve them. Design for software needs to be modular and issues need to be traceable to individual modules.
