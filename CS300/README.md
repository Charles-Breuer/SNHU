# CS300

What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?

 The problem I was solving in the projects for this course was using different data structures to hold a container object and do different relevant operations. The best data structure that has the lowest runtime and memory usage for necessary operations would be chosen. The container object is a course that includes its title, number, and relevant prerequisites. The different data structures that were assessed include the vector, binary search tree, hash table, and linked list. The data structure that was chosen to work the best was the binary search tree.
  
How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.

  picking the best data structure for the use case required looking at the most common operations done with the data structure during normal use. Placing the different necessities for the data structure in a ranked fashion helps make the decision process easier. For my choice, I realized that the main operation that will be taken is outputting the list of classes for students to look at. The data structure that undertook this operation with the least memory and runtime overhead was the binary search tree. Other relevant functions such as loading the courses into the data structure and searching for a particular course were taken into account as well.
  
How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?

  Whenever I got stuck on a problem, I would work on some other problem for another project. When I came back to the original project, typically I had a new idea on how to figure out the algorithm. Breaking the project into small manageable sections helps to decrease the stress and allow for a concurrent operation on different aspects of the same project.
  
How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?

  this project has made me rethink a lot of the algorithms that I have made in the past. This project allows me to put algorithms that I work on into perspective and design data structures that better suit specific situations. I am currently working on a game engine, and certain ideas such as binary search helps with certain concepts such as searching for entities inside of a map.
  
How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

  I have learned to write more efficient comments when discussing different aspects of software. I understand it is important to explain an algorithm well, however, it is also important to leave space for a new programmer to read the algorithm as it is.
